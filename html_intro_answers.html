<p style="text-align: justify;">For twelve long years, the dread fortress of Azkaban held an infamous prisoner named Sirius Black. Convicted of killing thirteen people with a single curse, he was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord, Voldemort.Now he has escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter's defeat of You-Know-Who was Black's downfall as well. And the Azkaban guards heard Black muttering in his sleep, "He's at Hogwarts . . . he's at Hogwarts."Harry Potter isn't safe, not even within the walls of his magical school, surrounded by his friends. Because on top of it all, there may well be a traitor in their midst.</p>

<h4>Personal Though</h4>
<p>My personal thought about this book is that <em>Harry</em> needs to be strong in order to protect his family and friends against the forces of <em>Voldemort</em>, the pain and agony of losing love ones that Harry carries until he grows up. There are things that we cannot see and tell there are still good people thus we  don't need to judge the book by its cover.</p>
